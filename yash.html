        <h1>ME, MYSELF AND I</h1>
        <p>
        Hello! My name is Yash Tyagi and I am from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/7TrKDjjS2csMr8mM9" target="_blank">Dehradun, Uttarakhand</a>. I am currently pursuing Computer Science Engineering Core from VIT Vellore. I am a passionate individual with a zest for life and a thirst for knowledge. In my free time, I like: <ul><li>watching anime</li><li>listening to music</li><li>socialising with my friends</li></ul> I've recently joined the gym, and it's turning out to be one of my favourite hobbies. With a curious and open-minded attitude, I am always looking for new ways to challenge myself and expand my horizons. I look forward to being a part of this club, meeting new people, and can't wait to learn more about web development.

        <p>Speaking of learning, let's take a look at my timetable:</p><br>

            One of my favourite things to do when I'm free from academics is to watch science fiction movies/series, especially anime. The most recent movie I've watched is <a href="https://youtu.be/zSWdZVtXT7E" target="_blank">Interstellar</a>. It was the first time I've watched it, and was really impressed with the scientific accuracy of the movie. It deserves all the praise it gets and much more.
